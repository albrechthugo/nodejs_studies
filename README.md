A backend project made in Node.js using TypeScript and Express with studies purpose. My goal with it is learn more about Node.js, backend design patterns and best practices. Also, i want to learn about pure SQL, and that is the reason of this project doesn't use any ORM or query builder.

I'm using a docker image of Postgres.
